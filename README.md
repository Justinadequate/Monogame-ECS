# Monogame-ECS

This was my first stab at game development using an Entity Component System pattern. It went through many iterations, including an attempt at a raycaster engine, but currently exists as base for a 2D sidescroll or top-down game. To run, a simple `dotnet build` -> `dotnet run` should do the trick with the Monogame 3.8 / .NET 3.1 runtimes.

Most of the time spent on this current iteration was hooking up the animation player and importing maps and textures with TileD.

In the future I would like to use this project further explore different methods of implementing an ECS.
